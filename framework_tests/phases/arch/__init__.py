Architecture Phase Tests
Tests for the complete Architecture phase implementation

Tests cover all PATH pillars:
- Process: Workflows, quality gates, validation
- AI: Domain analyst, system architect, component designer, integration architect
- Technology: Architecture tools, design patterns, modeling frameworks
- Human: Oversight, approval gates, creative input
