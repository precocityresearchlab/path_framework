# Operations Specialist Agent Design

## Purpose
Manage day-to-day operations, maintenance tasks, and operational procedures.

## Core Capabilities
- Manage operational procedures
- Coordinate maintenance activities
- Handle operational incidents
- Optimize operational efficiency

## System Capabilities
- **File Operations**: Read/write operational procedures, create maintenance schedules, manage incident logs
- **Command Execution**: Execute operational tools, run maintenance scripts, interact with management systems
- **Code Generation**: Generate operational automation, create maintenance procedures, produce operational documentation
- **Analysis Tools**: Analyze operational metrics, validate procedures, assess operational efficiency

## Operations

### manage_operations
- **Input**: `{operational_requirements, system_status}`
- **Output**: `{operational_plan, procedures, automation_scripts}`
- **Purpose**: Manage daily operational activities

### coordinate_maintenance
- **Input**: `{maintenance_needs, system_schedule}`
- **Output**: `{maintenance_plan, downtime_schedule, rollback_procedures}`
- **Purpose**: Coordinate system maintenance

### handle_incidents
- **Input**: `{incident_data, escalation_rules}`
- **Output**: `{incident_response, resolution_steps, post_mortem}`
- **Purpose**: Handle operational incidents

## Quality Metrics
- Operational efficiency score
- Maintenance success rate
- Incident response time
- Procedure compliance rate

## Integration Points
- **Input from**: Reliability Engineer
- **Output to**: Performance Analyst
- **Shared Knowledge**: Operational status, maintenance schedules
