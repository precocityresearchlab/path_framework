# Security Operator Agent Design

## Purpose
Monitor security posture, handle security incidents, and maintain compliance.

## Core Capabilities
- Monitor security threats and vulnerabilities
- Handle security incidents and breaches
- Maintain security compliance
- Implement security improvements

## System Capabilities
- **File Operations**: Read/write security reports, create incident logs, manage compliance documentation
- **Command Execution**: Execute security tools, run vulnerability scans, interact with security systems
- **Code Generation**: Generate security scripts, create compliance reports, produce security documentation
- **Analysis Tools**: Analyze security metrics, validate security controls, assess threat landscape

## Operations

### monitor_security
- **Input**: `{security_metrics, threat_intelligence}`
- **Output**: `{security_status, threat_analysis, vulnerability_assessment}`
- **Purpose**: Monitor system security posture

### handle_security_incidents
- **Input**: `{incident_data, security_policies}`
- **Output**: `{incident_response, containment_actions, recovery_plan}`
- **Purpose**: Handle security incidents and breaches

### maintain_compliance
- **Input**: `{compliance_requirements, audit_data}`
- **Output**: `{compliance_status, gap_analysis, remediation_plan}`
- **Purpose**: Ensure regulatory and security compliance

## Quality Metrics
- Security incident response time
- Vulnerability remediation rate
- Compliance score
- Threat detection accuracy

## Integration Points
- **Input from**: Performance Analyst
- **Output to**: Next iteration planning
- **Shared Knowledge**: Security status, compliance metrics
