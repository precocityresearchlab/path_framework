## Key Components

### Base Agent (`core/base_agent.py`)
- Single agent runtime that loads specialized profiles
- Handles requests using profile-specific logic
- Manages communication, knowledge base, and validation

### Profiles (`profiles/`)
- 16 specialized agent profiles across 4 phases
- Each profile implements specific capabilities and operations
- Dynamic loading based on agent requirements

### Communication Layer (`communication/protocols.py`)
- Message-based communication between agents
- Event publishing and subscription
- Protocol abstraction for different transport mechanisms

### Knowledge Base (`knowledge/knowledge_base.py`)
- Centralized storage for project context, patterns, and rules
- Semantic search and retrieval capabilities
- Performance metrics and lessons learned

### Human Validation (`validation/human_validation.py`)
- Structured human approval workflows
- Validation request/response handling
- Escalation and audit trail management

## Usage

```python
from core.base_agent import BaseAgent, AgentRequest

# Create specialized agent
agent = BaseAgent("domain_analyst")

# Create request
request = AgentRequest(
    request_id="req_001",
    operation="analyze_user_story",
    payload={"user_story": "As a user..."}
)

# Process request
response = await agent.process_request(request)
```

## Running the Demo

```bash
cd src
python3 main.py
```

This will demonstrate:
1. Domain Analyst analyzing a user story
2. System Architect generating architecture options
3. Agent communication and knowledge sharing

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining profile operations
2. Add real LLM integration for reasoning
3. Implement actual database backends
4. Add REST API endpoints
5. Create web UI for human validation
6. Add comprehensive testing
