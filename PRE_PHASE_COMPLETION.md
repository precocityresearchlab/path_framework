### Agent Framework Foundation
```
PATH Framework Agents (16 total across 4 phases):
├── Phase 1: Software Engineering (4 agents)
├── Phase 2: TDD Implementation (4 agents)  
├── Phase 3: DevOps & CI/CD (4 agents)
└── Phase 4: Production Operations (4 agents)
```

### Build & Distribution
- **Successful Package Build**: `path_framework-1.0.0.tar.gz` and `.whl` generated
- **CLI Functionality**: `uv run path agents list` displays all 16 agents correctly
- **Makefile Commands**: All UV-based commands working (`make uv-check`, `make test`, `make build`)

## 🔧 Makefile Command Portfolio (50+ commands)

### Core Development
- `make uv-check` - Verify UV and dependencies
- `make uv-sync` - Sync all dependencies
- `make uv-add` - Add new packages
- `make test` - Run test suite with coverage
- `make build` - Build package distributions

### Code Quality
- `make lint` - Run all linting tools
- `make format` - Format code with black and isort
- `make security` - Security scanning with bandit and safety
- `make type-check` - MyPy type checking

### Documentation & Deployment
- `make docs` - Generate Sphinx documentation
- `make agents-list` - Display PATH Framework agents
- `make docker-build` - Build Docker containers
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
