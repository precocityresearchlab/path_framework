  - **agent_integration_architect**: Orchestrate multi-protocol device communication and data aggregation
  - **agent_implementation_designer**: Structure protocol-agnostic folder organization with adapter patterns
  - **agent_documentation_specialist**: Document protocol compliance and device security architectural decisions
- **Outcome**: Scalable IoT platform with multiple protocol support and comprehensive security validation

### Key Success Patterns Across Agent Teams
- **Specification-driven component design** (led by **agent_compliance_validator**) ensures compliance across all domains
- **Clear separation of protocol/business logic** (coordinated by **agent_component_designer**) enables comprehensive testing
- **Systematic pattern application** (led by **agent_architect**) provides consistency across all agent contributions
- **Comprehensive validation** (orchestrated by **agent_compliance_validator**) maintains quality standards across all agent domains

This agent-centric meta-prompt enables specialized LLM agent teams to systematically architect software applications across any domain by providing structured context, objective decision criteria, and comprehensive validation frameworks. The methodology ensures AI-driven software design maintains consistency, quality, and compliance through coordinated agent expertise regardless of application complexity or domain specificity.

## Agent Implementation Checklist

### Phase Completion Validation by Agent Role
- [ ] **Phase 1** (**agent_domain_analyst** + **agent_compliance_validator**): Domain model extracted and validated against specifications
- [ ] **Phase 2** (**agent_architect** + supporting agents): Architectural pattern selected with quantified justification from all relevant agents  
- [ ] **Phase 3** (**agent_architect** + **agent_component_designer**): Component structure defined with clear layer responsibilities
- [ ] **Phase 4** (**agent_component_designer** + supporting agents): Interfaces designed following SOLID principles with cross-agent validation
- [ ] **Phase 5** (**agent_implementation_designer** + **agent_component_designer**): Implementation structure documented with naming conventions
- [ ] **Phase 6** (**agent_integration_architect** + supporting agents): Integration patterns defined with dependency management across agent domains
- [ ] **Phase 7** (**agent_compliance_validator** + **agent_documentation_specialist**): Compliance matrix completed with requirement traceability across all agent contributions

### Quality Gates for Agent Teams
- **Multi-Agent Consistency Check**: All components align with selected architectural pattern across agent specializations
