# PATH Framework: Process/AI/Technology/Human for Software Engineering

**Version 2.0.0** | **Released: August 3, 2025**

## Definition
**PATH Framework** (Process/AI/Technology/Human) is a comprehensive methodology framework that structures software engineering practices around four integrated phases: Software Engineering, Test-Driven Development, DevOps & Production Readiness, and Production Operations & Maintenance. Each phase implements the PATH model to ensure systematic, scalable, and technology-enabled software delivery through collaborative human-AI teams.
