# Token Economy and Verbosity Control

## Purpose
Ensures efficient token usage and minimal verbosity in all PATH Framework implementations and responses.

## Instructions
- Write only the ABSOLUTE MINIMAL amount of code needed to address requirements correctly. (ID: MINIMAL_CODE)
- Avoid verbose implementations that don't directly contribute to the solution. (ID: AVOID_VERBOSITY)
- Minimize output tokens while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. (ID: MINIMIZE_TOKENS)
- Address only the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information. (ID: FOCUSED_RESPONSES)
- Use concise, direct language without unnecessary explanations or elaboration. (ID: CONCISE_LANGUAGE)
- Eliminate redundant code, comments, or documentation unless explicitly required. (ID: ELIMINATE_REDUNDANCY)
- Prioritize actionable information over general explanations. (ID: ACTIONABLE_FOCUS)

## Priority
High

## Error Handling
- If response is verbose, refactor to essential information only.
- If code includes unnecessary elements, remove non-contributing parts.
- If explanations are lengthy, condense to core concepts.
