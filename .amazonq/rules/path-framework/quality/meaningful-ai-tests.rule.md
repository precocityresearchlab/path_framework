# Meaningful AI Test Generation

## Purpose
Ensures AI-generated tests are meaningful and enforce behavior rather than being trivial placeholder tests.

## Instructions
- Generate specification-driven tests with diverse scenarios including boundary conditions. (ID: SPECIFICATION_DRIVEN_TESTS)
- Create behavioral assertions that validate functionality, not just return values. (ID: BEHAVIORAL_ASSERTIONS)
- Validate test meaningfulness through mutation testing with >80% mutation score. (ID: MUTATION_TESTING_VALIDATION)
- Include comprehensive edge case coverage and invariant testing. (ID: COMPREHENSIVE_EDGE_CASES)
- Implement human-in-the-loop validation for AI-generated test quality. (ID: HUMAN_VALIDATION_LOOP)
- Measure assertion richness with >3 meaningful assertions per test. (ID: ASSERTION_RICHNESS)
- Ensure tests trace back to functional specifications and requirements. (ID: SPECIFICATION_TRACEABILITY)

## Priority
High

## Error Handling
- If mutation score is <80%, regenerate tests with better behavioral coverage.
- If tests are trivial (only checking return values), enhance with behavioral assertions.
- If specification traceability is missing, link tests to requirements.
