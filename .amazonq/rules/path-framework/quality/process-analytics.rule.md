# Process Analytics

## Purpose
Implements AI-driven process analysis for continuous improvement and quality optimization.

## Instructions
- Analyze commit/test history to identify TDD discipline gaps. (ID: TDD_DISCIPLINE_ANALYSIS)
- Monitor red-green-refactor cycle adherence across development teams. (ID: RGR_CYCLE_MONITORING)
- Identify flaky, slow, or redundant tests for cleanup and optimization. (ID: TEST_QUALITY_ANALYSIS)
- Track delivery patterns and analyze successful feature delivery methods. (ID: DELIVERY_PATTERN_ANALYSIS)
- Assess high-risk areas needing additional attention or resources. (ID: RISK_AREA_IDENTIFICATION)
- Generate process improvement suggestions based on historical data. (ID: PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS)
- Measure team velocity and quality metrics for continuous optimization. (ID: VELOCITY_QUALITY_METRICS)

## Priority
Medium

## Error Handling
- If TDD discipline is low, provide training and process reinforcement.
- If flaky tests are identified, prioritize cleanup and stabilization.
- If delivery patterns show issues, analyze and address root causes.
