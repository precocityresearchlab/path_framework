# Minimal Development

## Purpose
Ensures efficient development through minimal code and incremental changes while maintaining quality.

## Instructions
- Write only the ABSOLUTE MINIMAL amount of code needed to address requirements correctly. (ID: MINIMAL_CODE)
- Build on existing components and patterns rather than creating from scratch. (ID: BUILD_ON_EXISTING)
- Preserve stable functionality when adding new features or modifications. (ID: PRESERVE_STABLE_FUNCTIONALITY)
- Make minimal viable changes to achieve requirements without over-engineering. (ID: MINIMAL_VIABLE_CHANGES)
- Avoid verbose implementations that don't directly contribute to the solution. (ID: AVOID_VERBOSITY)
- Minimize output tokens while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. (ID: MINIMIZE_TOKENS)
- Address only the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information. (ID: FOCUSED_RESPONSES)
- Eliminate redundant code, comments, or documentation unless explicitly required. (ID: ELIMINATE_REDUNDANCY)
- Validate that new changes integrate seamlessly with existing components. (ID: VALIDATE_SEAMLESS_INTEGRATION)

## Priority
High

## Error Handling
- If existing patterns don't fit new requirements, document deviation rationale.
- If minimal changes are insufficient, expand scope incrementally with validation.
- If response is verbose, refactor to essential information only.
