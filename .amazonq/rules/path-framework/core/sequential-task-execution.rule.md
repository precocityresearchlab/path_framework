# Sequential Task Execution

## Purpose
Ensures focused execution by completing one task fully before starting the next, preventing context switching and incomplete work.

## Instructions
- Complete one task fully before starting the next task. (ID: ONE_TASK_AT_A_TIME)
- Mark tasks as complete with timestamp before proceeding to next task. (ID: MARK_COMPLETE_BEFORE_NEXT)
- Avoid working on multiple tasks simultaneously to maintain focus and quality. (ID: AVOID_MULTITASKING)
- Validate task completion criteria are met before moving forward. (ID: VALIDATE_COMPLETION_CRITERIA)
- Update task tracking systems immediately after completion. (ID: UPDATE_TRACKING_IMMEDIATELY)
- Commit and push all changes related to current task before starting next. (ID: COMMIT_BEFORE_NEXT)

## Priority
High

## Error Handling
- If task completion is unclear, define explicit completion criteria before proceeding.
- If multiple urgent tasks arise, prioritize and queue them rather than working simultaneously.
- If task dependencies require parallel work, break into smaller sequential subtasks.
- TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycles are considered micro-tasks within larger task completion.
