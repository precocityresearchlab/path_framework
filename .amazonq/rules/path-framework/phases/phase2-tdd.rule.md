# Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

## Purpose
Enforces TDD methodology and testing practices in PATH Framework Phase 2.

## Instructions
- Write tests first, then write code to pass those tests. (ID: TESTS_FIRST)
- Follow red-green-refactor cycle: failing test, minimal code, clean refactor. (ID: RED_GREEN_REFACTOR)
- Maintain >90% test coverage for all code. (ID: TEST_COVERAGE)
- Create acceptance tests from user story criteria. (ID: ACCEPTANCE_TESTS)
- Ensure all code is clean, readable, and traceable to user stories. (ID: CLEAN_TRACEABLE_CODE)

## Priority
Critical

## Error Handling
- If tests are not written first, remind about TDD discipline.
- If coverage is below 90%, identify missing test cases.
