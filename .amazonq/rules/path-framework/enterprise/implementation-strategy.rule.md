# Enterprise Implementation Strategy

## Purpose
Guides enterprise-scale adoption of PATH Framework with phased approach and risk management.

## Instructions
- Implement phased adoption: pilot program, gradual rollout over 12 months. (ID: PHASED_ADOPTION)
- Start with single team, single project pilot to validate benefits. (ID: PILOT_PROGRAM)
- Ensure minimal prerequisites: development team, basic CI/CD, standard tools. (ID: MINIMAL_PREREQUISITES)
- Track implementation costs: $375K-$900K total investment. (ID: IMPLEMENTATION_COSTS)
- Measure ROI: $1M-$4.3M annual benefits, 167-378% first-year ROI. (ID: ROI_MEASUREMENT)
- Achieve 3-6 month break-even timeline through systematic adoption. (ID: BREAK_EVEN_TIMELINE)
- Provide fallback options to traditional methods if needed. (ID: FALLBACK_OPTIONS)

## Priority
Medium

## Error Handling
- If pilot program fails, analyze issues and adjust approach before scaling.
- If ROI targets are not met, reassess implementation strategy and costs.
- If break-even timeline is exceeded, identify and address adoption barriers.
