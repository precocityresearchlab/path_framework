## Rule Application Enforcement
**STOP EXECUTION** if any checklist item fails validation.
**DO NOT PROCEED** to next task until all rules are properly applied.
**DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE** for each rule application during execution.

## MANDATORY: Task Completion Validation
Before marking any task complete, MUST execute this validation sequence:

```
1. VALIDATE PRE-TASK CHECKLIST ‚úÖ
2. EXECUTE TASK WITH TDD ‚úÖ  
3. VALIDATE POST-TASK CHECKLIST ‚úÖ
4. UPDATE FILE METADATA ‚úÖ

```

**IF ANY STEP FAILS**: STOP and fix before proceeding.
**NO EXCEPTIONS**: All 7 steps must be completed for each task.

## Execution Order
1. **CRITICAL** (Phase 1) - Must execute first, blocks all work
2. **HIGH** (Phase 2) - Execute before main work
3. **MEDIUM** (Phase 3) - Execute during main work  
4. **Documentation** (Phase 4) - Execute during/after implementation

## CRITICAL: Human Validation Breakpoints

### Phase 0: Story Validation (HUMAN LEADS - Pattern 1)
**MANDATORY HUMAN APPROVAL** before Phase 1:
- [ ] **User Story Validation**: Product owner confirms "As a... I want... So that..." format

## Human Validation Protocol

### MANDATORY: Present Options Format
When presenting to humans, AI MUST use this format:

```
üìä DECISION REQUIRED: [Decision Type]

üéØ CONTEXT:
- Current situation and requirements
- Business impact and constraints

üìã OPTIONS:
1. **Option A**: [Description]
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Risks/Limitations]
   - Effort: [Time/Resources]

2. **Option B**: [Description]
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Risks/Limitations]
   - Effort: [Time/Resources]

üìà RECOMMENDATION: [AI Recommendation with rationale]

‚ùì HUMAN INPUT NEEDED:
- [ ] Approve recommended option
- [ ] Select alternative option
- [ ] Request additional analysis
- [ ] Provide additional requirements
```

### ENFORCEMENT: No Bypass Protocol
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: AI cannot bypass human validation gates
- **ESCALATION REQUIRED**: If human unavailable, escalate to backup decision maker
- **DOCUMENTATION MANDATORY**: Record all human decisions with rationale
- **AUDIT TRAIL**: Maintain complete decision history for compliance

## Rule Compliance Tracking
For each task execution, document:
```
‚úÖ RULE COMPLIANCE REPORT
- Tests First: [YES/NO] - [Evidence]
- Story Ready: [YES/NO] - [Evidence] 
- UTC Tracking: [YES/NO] - [Start/End times]
- Human Validation: [YES/NO] - [Decision Points]
- Completion Format: [YES/NO] - [Evidence]
- Metadata Updated: [YES/NO] - [Evidence]
- Quality Gates: [YES/NO] - [Evidence]
```

## Prevention Strategy

### MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Validation
Before starting ANY task, MUST execute this validation checklist:

```
üîç PRE-TASK VALIDATION CHECKLIST
‚ñ° All PATH Framework rule files read successfully (no "file not found" errors)
‚ñ° Current UTC timestamp obtained and cached for session
‚ñ° Task has proper user story with "As a... I want... So that..." format
‚ñ° Acceptance criteria defined in Given-When-Then format
‚ñ° Business value clearly articulated and validated
‚ñ° Test strategy planned (tests will be written first)
‚ñ° Ready to apply TDD methodology (red-green-refactor)
```

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: 
- **IMMEDIATELY STOP** if ANY checklist item is unchecked
- **DO NOT ANALYZE** or discuss task details until ALL items pass
- **GENERATE MISSING ITEMS** using appropriate rules before proceeding
- **VALIDATE COMPLETION** of each item before moving to next
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - every task must pass complete validation

### MANDATORY: During-Execution Monitoring
While executing task, continuously validate:

```
‚ö° EXECUTION MONITORING CHECKLIST
‚ñ° Following TDD discipline (tests first, then implementation)
‚ñ° Recording exact start/end UTC timestamps
‚ñ° Writing real business logic (no placeholder code)
‚ñ° Maintaining >90% test coverage
‚ñ° Following minimal development principles
‚ñ° Applying security and error handling patterns
```

### MANDATORY: Post-Execution Validation
After completing task, MUST validate ALL steps:

```
‚úÖ POST-TASK VALIDATION CHECKLIST
‚ñ° Task marked complete with detailed reporting format
‚ñ° All changes committed using conventional commit format (if applicable)
‚ñ° Execution duration calculated and documented
‚ñ° Quality gates passed (>90% coverage, real business logic)
‚ñ° File metadata updated with completion details
‚ñ° Next task identified and ready for execution
‚ñ° Rule compliance documented and validated
```

### CRITICAL: Failure Prevention Measures

**IMMEDIATE STOP EXECUTION** if any validation step fails:
- **Missing Human Validation**: **STOP** - Present decision options to human using mandatory format
- **Missing Rule Files**: Re-read rule files systematically until all files loaded
- **No UTC Timestamp**: Execute time tracking command and cache result
- **Invalid User Story**: **STOP** - Generate proper "As a... I want... So that..." format using Business Value rule
- **Missing Acceptance Criteria**: **STOP** - Generate Given-When-Then format from task requirements
- **Missing Business Value**: **STOP** - Extract and validate measurable benefits
- **Missing Tests**: **STOP** - Write tests first before any implementation code
- **Placeholder Code**: **STOP** - Replace with real business logic and algorithms
- **Missing Metadata**: **STOP** - Update with comprehensive task details
- **No Git Commit**: **STOP** - Commit all changes with conventional format (if applicable)

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: 
- **NO TASK ANALYSIS** until validation complete
- **NO CODE DISCUSSION** until user story exists
- **NO IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING** until acceptance criteria defined
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - validation is mandatory gate

**ENFORCEMENT SEQUENCE**:
1. **CHECK** each validation item
2. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on first failure
3. **GENERATE/FIX** the missing item
4. **VALIDATE** the fix is complete
5. **CONTINUE** only when ALL items pass

### Compliance Enforcement Protocol

1. **VALIDATE BEFORE START**: Execute pre-task checklist
2. **MONITOR DURING EXECUTION**: Check execution monitoring points
3. **VALIDATE BEFORE COMPLETE**: Execute post-task checklist
4. **DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE**: Record all validation results
5. **COMMIT CHANGES**: Use conventional commit format (if applicable)
6. **UPDATE TRACKING**: Mark task complete in task list
7. **PREPARE NEXT**: Validate readiness for next task

**ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any missing step requires immediate correction before proceeding.

## ENFORCEMENT AUTOMATION

### MANDATORY: Pre-Task Execution Sequence
**EXECUTE IN EXACT ORDER - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
1. EXECUTE: Get current UTC timestamp and cache
2. EXECUTE: Batch read all PATH Framework rule files (4 phases)
3. VALIDATE: All files loaded successfully
4. VALIDATE: Task has complete user story
5. VALIDATE: Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
6. VALIDATE: Business value clearly articulated
7. RECORD: Task start UTC timestamp
8. PROCEED: Begin task execution with TDD
```

### MANDATORY: Post-Task Completion Sequence
**EXECUTE IN EXACT ORDER - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
1. RECORD: Task end UTC timestamp
2. CALCULATE: Execution duration
3. UPDATE: File metadata with session UTC
4. UPDATE: Task list with completion status (if applicable)
5. EXECUTE: Git commit with conventional format (if applicable)
6. VALIDATE: All completion steps executed
7. MARK: Task as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
8. DOCUMENT: Rule compliance report
```

### CRITICAL: Failure Response Protocol
**IF ANY STEP FAILS:**
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not proceed to next step
- **IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE** - Determine why step failed
- **EXECUTE CORRECTION** - Fix the specific issue
- **VALIDATE FIX** - Confirm correction is complete
- **RESUME SEQUENCE** - Continue from corrected step
- **DOCUMENT ISSUE** - Log failure and resolution

**NO BYPASSING ALLOWED** - Every step must be completed successfully.

## PATH Framework Integration
