# Functional Requirements Validation

## Purpose
Ensures all implementations contain real business logic and functional requirements rather than placeholder code.

## Instructions
- Define specific business rules and calculations for each component. (ID: DEFINE_BUSINESS_RULES)
- Specify exact algorithms and formulas where applicable. (ID: SPECIFY_ALGORITHMS)
- Include real-world test scenarios with actual data. (ID: REAL_WORLD_SCENARIOS)
- Validate expected business outcomes and edge cases. (ID: VALIDATE_OUTCOMES)
- Prohibit placeholder code in favor of functional implementations. (ID: NO_PLACEHOLDER_CODE)
- Document functional requirements before implementation begins. (ID: DOCUMENT_REQUIREMENTS_FIRST)

## Priority
High

## Error Handling
- If business rules are unclear, clarify with stakeholders before proceeding.
- If algorithms are complex, break into smaller, testable components.
- If test scenarios are missing, generate them from business requirements.
