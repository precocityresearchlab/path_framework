# System Architect Agent Design

## Purpose
Design overall system architecture based on domain model and technical requirements.

## Core Capabilities
- Design system architecture from domain models
- Select appropriate technology stack
- Define system components and boundaries
- Create architectural patterns and principles

## System Capabilities
- **File Operations**: Read/write architecture documents, create project templates, manage configuration files
- **Command Execution**: Execute build tools, run architecture validation scripts, interact with development tools
- **Code Generation**: Generate project scaffolding, configuration templates, architectural boilerplate
- **Analysis Tools**: Analyze existing systems, evaluate technology stacks, assess architectural patterns

## Operations

### design_architecture
- **Input**: `{domain_model, technical_constraints, non_functional_requirements}`
- **Output**: `{architecture_diagram, component_overview, technology_decisions}`
- **Purpose**: Create high-level system architecture

### select_technologies
- **Input**: `{requirements, constraints, preferences}`
- **Output**: `{technology_stack, justification, alternatives}`
- **Purpose**: Choose optimal technology stack

### define_components
- **Input**: `{architecture, domain_entities}`
- **Output**: `{components, boundaries, responsibilities}`
- **Purpose**: Break architecture into manageable components

### validate_architecture
- **Input**: `{architecture, quality_attributes}`
- **Output**: `{validation_results, recommendations, risks}`
- **Purpose**: Validate architecture against quality requirements

## Quality Metrics
- Architecture consistency score
- Technology alignment with requirements
- Component cohesion and coupling metrics
- Scalability and maintainability assessment

## Integration Points
- **Input from**: Domain Analyst
- **Output to**: Component Designer
- **Shared Knowledge**: System architecture, technology decisions
