# Deployment Specialist Agent Design

## Purpose
Automate application deployment with rollback capabilities and deployment strategies.

## Core Capabilities
- Implement deployment automation
- Configure rollback procedures
- Manage deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Ensure zero-downtime deployments

## System Capabilities
- **File Operations**: Read/write deployment scripts, create configuration files, manage deployment artifacts
- **Command Execution**: Execute deployment tools, run rollback commands, interact with orchestration systems
- **Code Generation**: Generate deployment automation, create rollback scripts, produce deployment documentation
- **Analysis Tools**: Analyze deployment metrics, validate deployment strategies, assess rollback procedures

## Operations

### automate_deployment
- **Input**: `{application_artifacts, deployment_config}`
- **Output**: `{deployment_automation, rollback_plan, monitoring_setup}`
- **Purpose**: Create automated deployment process

### execute_deployment
- **Input**: `{deployment_plan, target_environment}`
- **Output**: `{deployment_status, health_checks, rollback_readiness}`
- **Purpose**: Execute deployment with monitoring

### manage_rollback
- **Input**: `{deployment_issue, rollback_trigger}`
- **Output**: `{rollback_execution, recovery_status, incident_report}`
- **Purpose**: Handle deployment rollbacks

## Quality Metrics
- Deployment success rate
- Rollback time (MTTR)
- Zero-downtime achievement
- Deployment frequency

## Integration Points
- **Input from**: Infrastructure Engineer
- **Output to**: Monitoring Analyst
- **Shared Knowledge**: Deployment status, rollback procedures
