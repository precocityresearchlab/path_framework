- **Scope**: Any software handling credit card transactions

### Relevance to Software Development

Security-focused standards are critical for mitigating risks in web applications, APIs, and cloud environments. They guide developers in implementing secure coding practices, such as:

- **Input Validation**: Preventing injection attacks and data corruption
- **Encryption**: Protecting data in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Implementing proper authentication and authorization
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and remediation

Compliance is enforced through tools like static analysis and vulnerability scanners, and is essential to avoid penalties and maintain customer trust.

## 2. Quality and Process-Oriented Standards

**Scope**: These standards govern the software development lifecycle, ensuring consistent, high-quality code through structured processes and guidelines. They focus on maintainability, reliability, and traceability from requirements to deployment.

### Key Standards

#### ISO/IEC 12207 / 15288
- **Purpose**: Define processes for software and system lifecycle management
- **Methodology**: Applicable to agile and waterfall methodologies
- **Coverage**: Requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, maintenance
- **Benefits**: Improved process consistency and quality assurance

#### ISO/IEC 25010
- **Purpose**: Outlines a model for software quality
- **Attributes**: Maintainability, performance, usability, reliability, security
- **Measurement**: Provides metrics for quality assessment
- **Application**: Quality planning and evaluation throughout development

#### MISRA C/C++
- **Purpose**: Provides coding guidelines for embedded systems to prevent defects
- **Usage**: Widely used in safety-critical applications
- **Rules**: Specific coding rules to avoid common pitfalls
- **Tools**: Static analysis tools for automated checking

#### AUTOSAR C++14
- **Purpose**: Standardizes software architecture for automotive systems
- **Benefits**: Ensures modularity and interoperability
- **Scope**: Automotive embedded software development
- **Compliance**: Required for many automotive suppliers

### Relevance to Software Development

These standards enhance code quality by enforcing structured development practices and modular design, supporting activities like:

- **Code Factorization**: Breaking down complex code into manageable components
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure without changing functionality
- **Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive development documentation
- **Testing**: Systematic testing approaches and coverage requirements

They are critical in industries requiring high reliability, such as automotive and aerospace, and are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated compliance checks.

## 3. Industry-Specific Standards

**Scope**: Tailored to specific sectors, these standards address unique regulatory and operational requirements, such as data privacy in healthcare or functional safety in automotive systems. They often incorporate security and quality elements but are customized for industry needs.

### Key Standards

#### HIPAA / HITECH
- **Purpose**: Protects electronic health information (ePHI) in healthcare software
- **Requirements**: Encryption, access controls, breach notifications
- **Penalties**: Up to $1.5 million per incident
- **Scope**: Healthcare providers, insurers, and their business associates

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Purpose**: Regulates personal data processing for EU residents
- **Requirements**: Privacy-by-design, data minimization, consent management
- **Penalties**: Up to 4% of global revenue or â‚¬20 million
- **Scope**: Any software processing EU resident data

#### SOC 2
- **Purpose**: Ensures trust services criteria for SaaS and cloud providers
- **Criteria**: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy
- **Validation**: Through independent audits (Type I and Type II)
- **Benefits**: Customer trust and competitive advantage

#### ISO 26262
- **Purpose**: Governs functional safety for automotive software

- **Alignment**: Aligns with ISO 27001 for multi-cloud environments
- **Coverage**: 197 control objectives across 17 domains
- **Usage**: Cloud security assessment and compliance

#### ISO/IEC 42001
- **Purpose**: Emerging standard for AI management systems
- **Focus**: Ethical and secure AI development
- **Requirements**: AI governance, risk management, transparency
- **Status**: Published in 2023, gaining adoption

### Relevance to Software Development

Industry-specific standards ensure compliance with sector-specific regulations, critical for:

- **Market Access**: Required for operating in regulated industries
- **Legal Adherence**: Avoiding regulatory penalties and legal issues
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrating commitment to data protection and quality
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiation through compliance certification

They influence software design (e.g., GDPR's privacy requirements) and require robust documentation and auditing, often supported by compliance management tools.
