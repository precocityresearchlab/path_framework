## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive plan for building the AI agents that power the PATH Framework, using a **Task Management REST API** as our model use case to demonstrate the complete agent ecosystem.

## Model Use Case: Task Management REST API

### Project Specifications

- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with REST API
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks (following PATH methodology)
- **Team**: 3 developers + 1 DevOps engineer + AI agents

### Success Criteria
- Working REST API with CRUD operations

## Success Metrics and Validation

```yaml
agent_success_metrics:
  technical_metrics:
    response_time: "< 5 seconds for agent decisions"
    accuracy: "> 95% correct recommendations"
    consistency: "Same input produces same output"
    
  process_metrics:
    human_satisfaction: "> 8/10 rating from human team members"
    workflow_efficiency: "30% faster than traditional methods"
    quality_improvement: "50% fewer bugs in production"
    
  business_metrics:
    time_to_market: "40% faster delivery"
    cost_reduction: "25% reduction in development costs"
    knowledge_retention: "90% of decisions documented and traceable"
```

This comprehensive plan provides a complete roadmap for building the PATH framework agents using the task management API as a practical demonstration. Each agent is designed with specific capabilities, clear decision authority, and integration points with both other agents and human team members.

The plan includes:
1. **Detailed agent specifications** with capabilities and implementation
2. **Practical code examples** showing how agents work in practice
3. **Complete technology integration** with real tools and frameworks
4. **Clear success metrics** and validation criteria
5. **Realistic timeline** for implementation and testing

This approach ensures that the PATH framework agents are not just theoretical concepts but practical, working systems that can deliver real value to software development teams.
