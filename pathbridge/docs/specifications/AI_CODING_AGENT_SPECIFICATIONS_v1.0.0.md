## Abstract

This document provides comprehensive technical specifications for AI coding agents that implement the PATH (Process/AI/Technology/Human) Framework methodology. Based on the PATH Framework research paper v2.3.0, these specifications define 16 specialized AI agents across four phases of software development: Software Engineering, Test-Driven Development, DevOps & Production Readiness, and Production Operations. Each agent specification includes functional requirements, technical capabilities, integration protocols, human validation interfaces, and performance metrics. The specifications ensure systematic human-AI collaboration while maintaining quality, security, and business value delivery throughout the software development lifecycle.
