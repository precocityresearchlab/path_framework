## Usage Guidelines

### Specification ID Usage
1. **Documentation**: Use specification IDs in all technical documentation
2. **API Design**: Reference specification IDs in API endpoints and responses
3. **Testing**: Map test cases to specific specification IDs
4. **Traceability**: Link requirements to specification IDs for complete traceability
5. **Metrics**: Track performance against specific specification ID targets

### Code Examples
```yaml
# Agent Configuration Example
agent_config:
  agent_code: "DA"
  active_specifications:
    inputs: ["DA-IN-001", "DA-IN-002", "DA-IN-003", "DA-IN-004"]
    outputs: ["DA-OU-001", "DA-OU-002", "DA-OU-003", "DA-OU-004"]
    performance_targets:
      DA-PM-001: 0.95  # 95% story completeness
      DA-PM-004: 300   # 5 minutes in seconds
