## Agent Architecture

**Single Base Agent** with 16 specialized profiles:

### Phase 1: Software Engineering
- **DA**: Domain Analyst - Requirements & business logic analysis
- **SA**: System Architect - Architecture design & technology decisions
- **CD**: Component Designer - Component interfaces & specifications
- **IA**: Integration Architect - Integration patterns & protocols

### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development
- **TO**: TDD Orchestrator - ATDD/TDD cycle coordination
- **TS**: Test Strategist - Test generation & validation
- **IS**: Implementation Specialist - Code generation & patterns
- **CV**: Coverage Validator - Test coverage & quality analysis

### Phase 3: DevOps & Production
- **PA**: Pipeline Architect - CI/CD pipeline design
- **IE**: Infrastructure Engineer - Infrastructure as Code
- **DS**: Deployment Specialist - Deployment automation
- **MA**: Monitoring Analyst - Monitoring & alerting setup

### Phase 4: Operations
- **RE**: Reliability Engineer - System reliability & failure prediction
- **OS**: Operations Specialist - Operational task automation
- **PF**: Performance Analyst - Performance monitoring & optimization
- **SO**: Security Operator - Security monitoring & threat response

## Quick Start

```bash
cd pathbridge/src
python main.py
```

## Key Features

- **Profile-based Architecture**: Single agent loads specialized profiles dynamically
- **Inter-agent Communication**: Message-based communication between agents
- **Human Validation**: Structured approval workflows for critical decisions
- **Knowledge Base**: Centralized storage for project context & patterns
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await support for concurrent operations

## Integration

PathBridge integrates with the broader PATH Framework ecosystem:
- Uses PATH Framework rules and methodologies
- Generates artifacts for downstream phases
- Provides CLI interfaces through main framework
- Supports human-AI collaboration patterns
