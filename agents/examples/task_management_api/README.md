## Running the Complete Example

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies for the API
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Execute Full PATH Cycle
```bash
# Run the complete 4-phase implementation
python run_full_cycle.py

# Or run individual phases
python run_full_cycle.py --phase 1  # Software Engineering only
python run_full_cycle.py --phase 2  # TDD only
python run_full_cycle.py --phase 3  # DevOps only
python run_full_cycle.py --phase 4  # Operations only
```

### Monitor Progress
```bash
# View real-time agent activity
python monitor_agents.py

# Generate progress report
python generate_report.py
```

## Expected Outputs

5. **Configure monitoring** for your specific SLAs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Agent communication failures**: Check network connectivity and API keys
- **LLM rate limits**: Implement retry logic and request throttling
- **Test failures**: Review test strategy and implementation quality
- **Deployment issues**: Validate infrastructure configuration

## Contributing

To contribute to this example:

1. Follow the PATH Framework methodology
2. Maintain agent specialization boundaries
3. Include comprehensive tests
4. Document all decisions and reasoning
5. Validate with human review

This example demonstrates the full power of the PATH Framework, showing how human-AI collaboration can deliver high-quality software systematically and predictably.
