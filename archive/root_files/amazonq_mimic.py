Amazon Q Interaction Mimic - LOCAL SIMULATION ONLY

⚠️  WARNING: This does NOT call real Amazon Q APIs ⚠️

This is a LOCAL SIMULATION that mimics Amazon Q's behavior patterns:
- Template-based code generation (not LLM-powered)
- Local command execution with telemetry tracking
- Response formatting similar to Amazon Q's output

Real Amazon Q APIs are internal/proprietary and not publicly accessible.
This code demonstrates what programmatic Amazon Q interaction might look like.
