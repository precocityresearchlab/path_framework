# PATH Framework: People-Agent Teams/Process/Technology for Software Engineering

## Definition
**PATH Framework** (People-Agent Teams/Process/Technology) is a comprehensive methodology framework that structures software engineering practices around four integrated phases: Software Engineering, Test-Driven Development, DevOps & Production Readiness, and Production Operations & Maintenance. Each phase implements the PATH model to ensure systematic, scalable, and technology-enabled software delivery through collaborative human-AI teams.
